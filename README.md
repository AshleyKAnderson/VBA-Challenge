# VBA-Challenge

This is the second challenge project for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. I used tutors available from BCS to assist me in areas of my script. Assistants are: kpin, tsentle, brandonwong, umunyurangabi, and most of all Kat-P. 

# Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

*The ticker symbol
*Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
*The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
*The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

*Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:
